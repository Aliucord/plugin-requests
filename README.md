# Plugin Requests

This is the place to be for suggesting plugin ideas or finding new plugins to make that people want!

## How does it work?

### Submitting a request

Please make sure your plugin request has not already been made, you can check by searching basic related terms in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Aliucord/plugin-requests/issues) of this repository! When you submit your request, someone will look over it and make sure it's not a duplicate request.

Open an issue from the [issues tab](https://github.com/Aliucord/plugin-requests/issues) of this repository, let the template help you through creating one.

**Failure to stick to the provided template, or suggesting self-bot-like behavior may result in your issue being closed and rejected!**

### Taking a plugin that's "up for grabs"

If you'd like to take a plugin that's _"up for grabs"_ and work on it, you'll need to reply to the issue and let us know that's what you intend to do. Once you do this, we'll assign you and mark the issue as _"work in progress"_ in order to let others know too.

When taking requests, also consider whether you can complete the plugin. We expect that you can complete quality work if you decide to take it upon yourself to take a request. If you're taking requests to learn Java and Aliucord's patching API, that's fine too! Just make sure to start slow and not take a bite too big to start yourself off, we'd rather you start small and work your way up, it's easier to learn that way.

If you've already taken a request and you decide it's too much, or you've given up, that's okay! Just reply to the issue letting us know you've stopped working on the plugin, that way we can return it to _"up for grabs_" so others know they can pick it up.

### I've finished making the plugin!

That's great to hear, well done! Reply to the related GitHub issue with a link to the repository where it can be found with instructions to find the plugin build, something like downloading the `.zip` from the `builds` branch. We also allow you posting your plugin repositories as well as updates in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU).

### I really want _x_ plugin, but I don't know how to make it!

If you find another request you'd like to see, don't "bump" it by posting another reply in the thread (this can spam emails and make triage more difficult)! Instead, react to the request with a üëç emoji to let others know people want to see it done! Don't bother the developers, they're likely not getting paid to do this, so be patient!
