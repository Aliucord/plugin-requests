# ‚ö†Ô∏è TEMPORARILY CLOSED

Discord is rewriting the Android App from scratch. 
This means, Aliucord will also be remade from scratch, all old plugins will stop working and 
discord itself is different. Thus it makes no sense to have requests for the time being. 
Please be patient until requests are opened again. 

# Plugin Requests

This is the place to be for suggesting plugin ideas or finding new plugins to make that people want!


## How does it work?

### Submitting a request

Please make sure your plugin request has not already been made, you can check by searching basic related terms in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Aliucord/plugin-requests/issues) of this repository! 
Please also make sure the plugin you are requesting does not already exist, and doesn't fall into the list of Impossible/Disallowed Plugins. 

<details>
<summary><b>Examples of impossible plugins</b></summary>

+ Server side modifications - e.g. Notification modifications/exceptions (like bypassing Do not disturb mode)
+ Free nitro - all nitro features except for emotes/stickers (use NitroSpoof/FakeStickers, both send image URLs)
+ Custom Rich Presence (or RPC) - this is not possible on mobile versions, use a PC
+ Compatibility layer plugins (e.g. bdcompat) - BetterDiscord, powerCord, and other desktop plugins will need to be ported to Aliucord to work.
+ Reading messages in hidden/private channels
+ Voice and Video modifications - plugins can't do this
+ Logging in as a bot/using a bot token to login
+ See whether someone is appearing offline (invisible) or actually offline

<summary><b>Examples of disallowed plugins</b></summary>

+ Plugins that break Discord's TOS (besides the client modding part of course)
+ Selfbot behavior: Sending embeds, delete all my messages, AFK messages / auto reply, animated (auto changing) custom status
+ Spamming servers
+ Copying or Transferring servers

Open an issue from the [issues tab](https://github.com/Aliucord/plugin-requests/issues) of this repository, then let the template guide you through creating one. When you submit your request, someone will look over it and make sure it's not a duplicate request.

**Failure to stick to the provided template, making duplicate/already existing requests, or suggesting self-bot-like behavior may result in your issue being closed and rejected! If you continue to do this, you will (most likely) be banned from the repo/org.**

## Taking a plugin that's "up for grabs"

If you'd like to take a plugin that's _"up for grabs"_ and work on it, you'll need to reply to the issue and let us know that's what you intend to do. Once you do this, we'll assign you and mark the issue as _"work in progress"_ in order to let others know too.

When taking requests, also consider whether you can complete the plugin. We expect that you can complete quality work if you decide to take it upon yourself and take a request. If you're taking requests to learn Java/Kotlin and Aliucord's patching API, that's fine too! Just make sure to start slow and not take a bite too big to start yourself off, we'd rather you start small and work your way up, it's easier to learn that way.

If you've already taken a request and you decide it's too much, or you've given up, that's okay! Just reply to the issue letting us know you've stopped working on the plugin, that way we can return it to _"up for grabs_" so others know they can pick it up.

### I've finished making the plugin!

That's great to hear, well done! Reply to the related GitHub issue with a link to the repository where it can be found with instructions to find the plugin build, something like downloading the `.zip` from the `builds` branch. 

We also encourage you to post your plugin repositories as well as new plugins in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU). Users can then use the built-in Plugin Downloader to install your plugin.


## I really want _x_ plugin, but I don't know how to make it!

If you find another request you'd like to see, don't "bump" it by posting another reply in the thread (this can spam emails and make triage more difficult)! Instead, react to the request with a üëç emoji to let others know people want to see it done! 

*Don't bother the developers*, they're likely not getting paid to do this (most of us are also very lazy), so be patient!

### Thanks for reading, now go request or make some plugins!
